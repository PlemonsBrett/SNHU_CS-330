## Project Overview

*My final 3D scene featuring a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and stereo speakers*

For my final project in CS-330, I created a 3D representation of a study desk featuring several key components: a textured book, spiral notebook with pencil, coffee mug, and a stress ball. The scene showcases the application of various 3D modeling techniques, texturing, lighting, and interactive camera controls using OpenGL and C++.

Each object was carefully designed using primitive shapes such as boxes, cylinders, and spheres. The book was created using a box shape with detailed texturing for the cover and pages. The spiral notebook features a carefully created binding using small cylinders for the spiral wire, while the coffee mug combines a cylinder with a curved handle. The stress ball was implemented as a simple sphere with appropriate texturing to give it a tactile appearance.

The scene implements multiple light sources to create depth and dimension, with properly applied textures enhancing realism. Users can navigate the scene using keyboard controls (WASD for horizontal movement, QE for vertical movement) and mouse inputs for orientation, creating an interactive experience that showcases the 3D environment from various perspectives.

## New Skills Applied

Throughout this project, I gained significant experience in implementing a modular, class-based approach to 3D scene creation. One of the most valuable new skills I developed was the ability to compose complex objects by combining multiple primitive shapes while maintaining proper proportioning and visual fidelity. 

The implementation of hierarchical object management through my SceneManager class was particularly enlightening. This approach allowed for independent object manipulation, simplified scene composition, and clear ownership handling, which proved invaluable when adjusting object positions and scales during development.

I also deepened my understanding of material and texture management in OpenGL. Creating reusable functions for handling shader materials and UV coordinate scaling provided flexibility while maintaining clean, organized code. The ability to create custom functions that encapsulate rendering logic for specific components made the codebase more maintainable and easier to modify as the project evolved.

## Remaining Questions

Despite the progress made in this course, I still have several questions about computational graphics and visualizations:

1. How can techniques like normal mapping and parallax occlusion mapping be implemented to add more detail to 3D models without increasing polygon counts?

2. What are the best approaches for implementing more advanced lighting models, such as physically-based rendering (PBR), and how do they contribute to more realistic scenes?

3. How can animation systems be developed and integrated into static scenes to bring objects to life with realistic movement?

4. What optimization techniques can be used to maintain high performance with increasingly complex scenes, particularly for real-time applications?

5. How are industry-standard tools like Blender or Maya integrated into professional graphics pipelines, and what are the workflows for importing complex models into custom OpenGL applications?

## Future Applications

The skills developed during this project have numerous applications in my future educational and professional endeavors:

**Educational Pathway:**
These foundational skills in 3D graphics programming provide an excellent basis for exploring more advanced topics such as game engine architecture, computer vision, and virtual/augmented reality development. I plan to expand on these skills by delving deeper into shader programming and algorithmic approaches to procedural generation.

**Professional Applications:**
In a professional context, these skills are directly applicable to roles in game development, simulation software, data visualization, and interactive media. The principles of 3D modeling, lighting, and camera manipulation are fundamental across these domains, while the software engineering practices of modular design and code organization are universally valuable.

I'm particularly interested in exploring how these graphics skills could be combined with my interest in data visualization to create interactive 3D representations of complex datasets. The ability to clearly visualize and interact with information in three dimensions offers powerful new ways to understand and communicate complex concepts.

Furthermore, the problem-solving approaches developed during this project—breaking down complex visual targets into manageable components and implementing them systematically—transfers well to many other technical domains beyond computer graphics.

Overall, this project has provided me with both technical skills specific to computer graphics and broader software development practices that will serve as valuable assets in my continued education and professional growth.
